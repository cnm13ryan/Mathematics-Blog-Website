# Mathematics Blog Website

## Project's Title
Mathematics Blog Website

## Project Description
This project is a mathematics blog website that aims to provide a platform for users to share and learn about various topics in mathematics. One of the unique features of this website is the integration of optical character recognition (OCR) technology. With this feature, users can upload PDF files to the blog, and the system will automatically generate a blog post from the content of the PDF.

The project is currently in development, and we are working hard to improve its features and user experience. We chose to use OCR technology to make it easier for users to share their knowledge and insights in mathematics without having to manually input all the information. This project has presented us with numerous challenges, and we are excited about the potential features we can implement in the future.
